  ## Installation 💾
  Download the official ATHLEAGUE mobile app from the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store.
  
  ## Usage 💻
  Start off by registering an Athleague account. Once registered, navigate to the interactive map and begin tapping at locations of interest to place checkpoints. A circuit consists of at least two checkpoints, so once you have placed at least two checkpoints, you can select "DONE" to save the circuit. Once you have completed your circuit, you may publish it for the rest of the Athleague community to attempt and view.
